# ICC-T20-WC-Data-Analysis
As the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2021 has been started, here is a Data Analysis of records from past seasons (2007 to 2016) including different viz. like Top Batters with most runs, Best Strike Rates, most no of 6's, players with most no. of catches, etc.

The raw data that I have collected from Kaggle was not a very structured one. Hence, got understood how data cleaning (with the help of SQL and MS Excel) is the most important yet most tedious (sometimes frustrating too) job in Data Analysis.
